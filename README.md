# Applied-Deep-Learning-and-Artificial-Intelligence-assignment-3
In this assignment I have created a QA system that retrieve medical data from the National Library of Medicine, which offer open-sourced database and scientific papers. This is done by retrieving the data with a LangChain loader and combining it with a LLM. To combine the data base and the LLM a RetrievalQA chain is used from a Chroma model. Then the end of the code shows a promp and a question. Since the data is about cancer, then the promp is about a Cancer specialist who tries to educate young people about cancer. The question consist of, "how do i avoid getting cancer", "summarize the consequent of cancer at a young age" and "what is a general persona for a young person who got cancer. The first two question had a good answear from the RAG model, but the last one is not that good, which could come from lack of data and unspecified prompt.
