        "This assignment focuses on leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, particularly in the context of extracting and synthesizing information from various documents (or a document). You’ll be using Langchain to implement these concepts and create a system that not only generates responses but also retrieves relevant information from a database.\n",
        "\n",
        "#**Objective**\n",
        "# Task Description\n",
        "Your task is to create a system that uses RAG for extracting information from a set of documents or a document which can be either a scientific paper or report. This involves integrating a database to store vectors of document information and designing customized prompts to effectively use GPT models for generation. Here are some project ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Build a QA system that retrieves information from a given set of documents (or a document) to answer complex queries.\n",
        "*   Develop a tool for summarizing research papers, where the system extracts key points from a database of paper vectors.\n",
        "* Create a recommendation engine that suggests content based on user queries and retrieved document data.\n",
        "* Explore other innovative applications of RAG, such as automated content generation, data analysis, or any other creative use case you can envision.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Key Components**\n",
        "* **Database Integration:** Set up a database to store and retrieve vectors representing document information.\n",
        "* **Customized Prompts**: Design and implement prompts that effectively utilize GPT models for generation based on retrieved data.\n",
        "* **RAG Implementation**: Use Langchain to integrate retrieval-augmented generation in your system.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Data**\n",
        "* Utilize open-source datasets or create your own corpus of documents for retrieval.\n",
        "* Ensure the chosen datasets are suitable for demonstrating the capabilities of your RAG system."

            "As a cancer specialist, I must first emphasize that while there are certain steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing cancer, it is essential to understand that cancer can occur even without any known causes or risk factors. Nonetheless, here are some general tips that may help reduce your risk of getting cancer:\n",
            "1. Don't smoke or use tobacco products: Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable cancer deaths worldwide. Quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke can significantly reduce your risk of developing lung, mouth, throat, and other cancers.\n",
            "2. Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight or obese increases the risk of several types of cancer, including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight.\n",
            "3. Exercise regularly: Physical activity has been shown to reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.\n",
            "4. Eat a healthy diet: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the risk of cancer. Limit your intake of processed meat, sugar, and saturated fat.\n",
            "5. Protect yourself from the sun: Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Avoid excessive sun exposure by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and using sunscreen with a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30 or higher.\n",
            "6. Get vaccinated against HPV: The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common cause of cervical and other cancers. The HPV vaccine is recommended for boys and girls aged 11-12 years old, but it can still be beneficial for older individuals who have not yet been vaccinated.\n",
            "7. Limit alcohol consumption: Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of several types of cancer, including liver, breast, and colon cancer. For women, this means drinking no more than one drink per day, and for men, no more than two drinks per day.\n",
            "8. Manage stress: Chronic stress can weaken your immune system and increase your risk of cancer. Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n",
            "9. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can increase the risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n",
            "10. Stay up-to-date on cancer screenings: Early detection and treatment of cancer are critical for successful treatment outcomes. Make sure to follow the recommended cancer screening guidelines for your age and medical history.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, while these tips may help reduce your risk of getting cancer, they are not a guarantee. It's essential to be aware of your family medical history and any genetic mutations that may increase your risk of cancer. If you have concerns about your cancer risk, speak with your doctor or a genetic counselor.\n"
